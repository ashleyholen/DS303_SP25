## Hawaii Tourism Quick Stats

In 2024, Hawaii saw 

::: incremental
-   **9,689,113** visitors, +0.3% from 2023
-   **$20.68 billion** total visitor expenditures, -0.2% from 2023
-   **168,035** visitors arrived via cruise ship
-   Oahu remains the most visited Hawaiian island, with **5,814,176** visitors

## 

Tourism in Hawaii serves as the largest industry and a major source of economic growth and tax revenue, and represents roughly a quarter of Hawaii's economy. On the other hand, tourism can strain resources leading to congestion, higher costs of living, and potential environmental damage.

## Research Question

::: {.fragment .highlight .center-align}
How does visitor origin affect daily spending, controlling for year and spending category?
:::


## Data

- State of Hawaii Department of Business, Economic Development & Tourism Data Warehouse
- Selected filters of Groups By Market, Total Categories, Daily spending ($), and Annual frequency
- 960 rows x 6 columns 
- Variables: Category, Year, Group, Spending

## Data
- 12 visitor groups: Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, Korea, Latin America, New Zealand, Oceania, Taiwan, US East, US West
- (2009-2023)
- 6 Categories: Food and beverage, Entertainment & Recreation, Transportation, Shopping, Lodging, All other expenses

## Data 

```{r}
summary(filtered)
```



## Exploration

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary_filtered <- filtered %>%
  group_by(Year, Group) %>%
  summarize(total_spending = sum(Spending, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

ggplot(summary_filtered, aes(x = Year, y = total_spending, color = Group)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Total Spending ($)",
    title = "Total Spending Per Group Per Year"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() 
```

## Exploration

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# exploring with only the top 3 categories 

summary_filtered_top3 <- filtered_top3 %>%
  group_by(Year, Group) %>%
  summarize(total_spending = sum(Spending, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

ggplot(summary_filtered_top3, aes(x = Year, y = total_spending, color = Group)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Total Spending ($)",
    title = "Total Spending Per Group Per Year for Top 3 Groups"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() 
```

## Exploration

```{r}
ggplot(filtered, aes(x = Spending, y = Category, fill = Category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    x = "Total Spending ($)",
    y = "Category",
    title = "Total Spending by Category"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Methods

For this analysis I will be using **multivariable linear regression models** in order to examine how multiple independent variables such as visitor group, year, and spending category simultaneously influence daily spending. 

The first model looks at the individual effects of visitor group, year, and spending category on daily spending, understanding of their independent contributions. The second model was used to explore whether the relationship between visitor group and spending differs by category, by including an interaction term.


## Model 1 - Multivariable Linear Regression 
```{r, echo = TRUE}
model1 <- lm(Spending ~ Group + Year + Category, data = filtered)
summary(model1)
```
## Model 1 Interpretation: Overall Model Fit 

- Residual standard error: **15.14** — the average deviation between the observed and predicted spending values.
- Multiple R-squared: **0.7644** — ~76.4% of the variation in spending is explained by the model.
- Adjusted R-squared: **0.7601** - adjusted for the number of predictors

## Model 1 Interpretation: Variable Significance 

The base group alphabetically is visitors from Australia

- Canada: Spend $15.94 **less** on average 
- China: Spend $16.93 **more**
- Europe: Spend $14.29 **less** 
- New Zealand: Spend $6.59 **less**
- US East: Spend $9.35 **less**
- US West: Spend $15.15 **less** 

- Japan, Korea, Oceania, Latin America, Taiwan: not or marginally significantly different

## Model 1 Interpretation: Variable Significance 

The base group is Other spending 

- Lodging: Adds $76.18 to spending
- Entertainment & Recreation: Adds $11.26
- Food and Beverage: Adds $36.22
- Shopping: Adds $39.56
- Transportation: Adds $10.91

Time (Year) has a small but significant positive effect

## Model 2 - Multivariable Linear Regression with Interaction between Group and Category
This is looking at the possibility of groups spending more on different categories than others
```{r, echo = TRUE}
model2 <- lm(Spending ~ Group * Category + Year, data = filtered)
summary(model2)
```

## Model 2 Interpretation: Overall Model Fit 

- Residual standard error: **10.17** — the average deviation between the observed and predicted spending values
- Multiple R-squared: **0.8999** - the model explains ~90% of the variance in visitor spending, which is very strong 
- Adjusted R-squared: **0.8917** - adjusted for the number of predictors, still very strong

## Model 2 Interpretation: Variable Significance

- Visitors from China spend significantly more on shopping than other groups, about $12.839 per person per day on average 
- Korean visitors spend more on Food & Beverage and Transportation
- US and Canadian visitors spend less on shopping than average
- Shopping and Food/Beverage are consistently high across many groups
- There’s clear variation by group and category, justifying the interaction model

## Model Testing
Anova

```{r, echo=TRUE}
anova(model1, model2)
```
This demonstrates that Model 2, which includes the interaction between Group and Category is highly statistically significant. 

## Model Testing

Residual Standard Error
```{r, echo=TRUE}
#RSE (lower the better)
summary(model1)$sigma
summary(model2)$sigma
```

Root Mean Squared Error
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# RMSE model accuracy (lower the better)
sqrt(mean(residuals(model1)^2))
sqrt(mean(residuals(model2)^2))
```

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, the project explored how visitor origin influences daily spending in Hawai‘i, while controlling for year and spending category. Using data from the State of Hawai‘i DBEDT from 2009 to 2023, two linear regression models were tested. The final model (which included an interaction between visitor group and spending category) showed a strong fit, indicating that both origin and category significantly shape visitor spending behaviors. Notably, spending patterns vary not only across visitor groups but also depending on the specific category of spending, such as lodging, shopping, or food and beverage.

## Future Works 

The inclusion of interaction terms helped capture these nuanced differences more effectively than a basic additive model. For future research, incorporating seasonality, inflation-adjusted spending, COVID, or number of travelers could provide deeper insight into trends over time. I would also look into a predictive model.
